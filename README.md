# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the **Predicting Diabetes Likelihood Using Demographic and Clinical Data: A Data-Driven Approach to Risk Assessment** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## About This Project
In this repository, youâ€™ll find the work carried out by our community members in completing an end-to-end machine learning project. Please note that the resources available here is not to be used or copied without referencing the appropriate authors.

## Project Objectives
To assist healthcare organizations in making data-driven decisions and improving patient care by predicting diabetes likelihood based on demographic and health data.

**Key Questions and Insights:**
- What correlations exist between health metrics (e.g., BMI, HbA1c) and diabetes?
- How is diabetes distributed across demographic groups and locations?
- Which factors (e.g., comorbidities like hypertension) are key diabetes risk indicators?
- Can we identify high-risk groups for targeted interventions?
**Value Generation:**
- Risk Stratification: Early detection of at-risk individuals.
- Targeted Interventions: Tailoring healthcare to high-risk groups.
- Cost Efficiency: Reducing long-term treatment costs by preventing diabetes progression.


## Project Phases & Timelines
**Phase 1 - Data Cleaning & Analysis (Week 1):**
- Tasks: Handle data types and inconsistencies. Perform EDA to identify risk factors, correlations, and distributions of diabetes across demographics and locations.
- Milestone: Complete EDA (Univariate., Bi-variate, multivariate analysis) and correlation analysis.

**Phase 2 - Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (Week 2):**
- Tasks: Build new features, perform one-hot encoding, scale features, handle outliers.
- Milestone: Finalized features for model training.

**Phase 3 - Model Selection & Fine Tuning (Week 3):**
- Tasks: Train multiple models, compare performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC), tune hyperparameters.
- Milestone: Select the best-performing model.

**Phase 4 - Deployment (Week 4):**
- Tasks: Build a Streamlit app, integrate the model, deploy the app to Streamlit Cloud.
- Milestone: Fully deployed app providing diabetes risk predictions.

## Deliverables & Success Criteria
**Deliverables:**
- Machine Learning Model: A model to predict diabetes risk.
- Streamlit App: Deployed for real-time predictions.
- Code Repository: GitHub repository with version control via Git.
- Final Report: Documenting the entire process from data analysis to app deployment.

**Success Criteria:**
- Performance Metrics: Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Communication: Reports, app demonstrations, and repository sharing with stakeholders.
